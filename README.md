# Airbourne-F4

Driver interface layer for STM32F4xx chips. Based off https://github.com/superjax/airbourne but specifically only for the F4xx. The goal is to make this similar in simplicity to BreezySTM32

I'm currently hosting the CMSIS docs from [@mfauzi](https://github.com/mfauzi/STM32F4/tree/master/STM32F4%20Standard%20Peripheral%20Library/Libraries/CMSIS), on my [website](http://stm.lenords.net/Documentation/General/html/index.html).
